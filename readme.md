# Memrizr

This is the repository for the Memrizr memorization application tutorial which is a work in progress. If you're interested in the tutorial, check out the videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnrGn4P6C4P6yasdEJnEUhueTjCGXGuFe)!

You can find my written tutorials on my [dev.to feed](https://dev.to/jacobsngoodwin).

A chart of the tools and applications used in this tutorial is given below.

![App Overview](./application_overview.png)

To run this code, you will need docker and docker-compose installed on your machine. In the project root, run `docker-compose up`.

I also recommended that you use the development tool of your choice with any desired tools for go, react, vue, and node, and typescript configured.

Cheers, eh!
